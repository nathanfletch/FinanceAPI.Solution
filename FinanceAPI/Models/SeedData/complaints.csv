9/29/2021,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Check cashing service,Problem with customer service,None,"I am a college student and recently opened a Bank of America bank account about two weeks ago. I had received a financial aid check from my university and attempted to deposit the check through BofA 's mobile check deposit system. The next day my account was frozen and I had no access to any login, balance check, or any other service. After calling customer service the first time they told me I had to go in person to the bank to verify my identity to remove the freeze. Once at the bank I was told I actually needed to call customer service and receive an 'access code ' from a banker to remove the freeze. I called customer service who told me that in fact, the banker had to make the call. After informing the bank about this they told me I would need my social security card to verify my identity. Unfortunately, I go to school out of my home state and had to have my social security card mailed to me from home. After receiving my social security card a few days later I went to the bank again to verify my identity and hopefully remove the freeze. While I was there the banker told me that they were going to close the old account and open a new one. I was immediately suspicious of this as I was told that it was just a freeze that had to be removed and inquired about this but was told that this was the solution. I then asked about the check I had deposited and how I would receive the funds in this new account. The banker insisted that I would be able to deposit the check in this new account. So after creating the new account I attempted to deposit the check only to be told that it had already been deposited and was a duplicate deposit. I immediately called customer service again who told me they were going to transfer me to another department before dropping the call abruptly. I called again only to be told I had to deposit the check in person this time. It had now been two weeks since I first attempted to deposit the check. So I returned to the branch and asked to speak to someone who knew what was going on because clearly everyone I had talked to was generally incompetent and had been telling me contradictory information to what I had heard over customer service lines. The manager directed me back to the banker I had talked to before who made a call and apparently removed a freeze on my new account that I was completely unaware of to begin with as it had only been made ( in person ) a few hours before. I asked again what I should do about the check and was told by the banker to deposit it with the teller. After going to the teller to deposit it they again asked me if the check had been deposited before. I explained the situation again. From the teller window I could see essentially the entire staff working at the bank at that time gathering together clearly very confused. I waited again only to be told that apparently the check had cleared on the first account but because the account was closed today, they were mailing my money to me in a different check in approximately 7-10 business days. 

That would make it the third ( maybe fourth ) week I would have to go without being able to use my financial aid money leading me to spend my own money on necessities and expenses that should have been covered by my school 's financial aid. I was being prevented from accessing this money by BofA. At every stage of this process general confusion and incompetency was displayed by everyone I talked to with the exception of those on the customer service line who on multiple occasions had to apologize for the false information the people in the bank branch were telling me. After pushing the branch to let me access this money I was told "" there was nothing we can do '' among other blatant lies such as "" your account was actually closed yesterday '' when I witnessed in person the banker close my old account only hours before. I'm not sure whether this was an attempt to cover for the banker 's mistake ( as I had seen him clearly and easily be able to remove the freeze from my new account with a quick phone call ) or if it was just more general incompetence. Either way this bank has at every level prevented me from doing the simple process of opening a bank account and depositing a check.

9/21/2021,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"I had a closing scheduled for a property she and her son were purchasing in South Carolina for on or aboutXX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2021. Unfortunately, the law firm that was handling the closing for me and my son, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ), had a security breach shortly before this date. As a result, I began to get emails instructing me where to send purchase money for the closing from a scammer using an email account that was very convincingly impersonating the email account of the paralegal we had been working with at XXXX. Following the instructions in these fraudulent emails, I ended up authorizing a wire in the amount of {$24000.00} to the account number indicated therein on XX/XX/ 2021. The following day, as soon as I found out these emails had been faked and we had just wired the money to the wrong account number, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and requested that a wire recall be sent. 

I also immediately reported this incident to the FBI, the FBIs XXXX XXXX, and the XXXX Police Department, and continued to communicate with the managers of both bank branches involved in the fraudulent transaction : XXXX XXXX, manager at Wells Fargo Bank, and XXXX XXXX, manager at XXXX XXXX. I provided all the documentation of the reports I had made to the police and to the FBI to both managers, as well as a copy of the actual email conversation that took place between us and the persons perpetrating the fraud through the impersonated email account. I was given assurance from both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ( both from XXXX XXXX  ), that the scammers bank account had been frozen, the money was still present in the account, and that we would be getting our money back. we expressed our gratitude and asked that they please contact me if they needed any additional information to help them in concluding their investigation. 
Subsequently, on or about XX/XX/2021, I had another phone conversation with XXXX XXXX, who again told me that I would be getting my money back either that same day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) or the following day ( XX/XX/XXXX ). He stated that they had been able to flag and freeze the scammers account because the account beneficiarys name was different from the actual name on the account. Me and my family were so relieved and grateful. I sent an email to XXXX XXXX following our conversation to confirm what was discussed ( also attached ). However, several days passed and I did not receive the money back as promised. 

I reached out multiple times to inquire about the status of the investigation and reversal of the wire. I spoke to XXXX XXXX again, but she informed me she could not reach the Wells Fargo investigator and implied that she was not able to do anything further. I did not believe MsXXXX XXXX was doing everything that was within her power to do. Therefore, I decided that I would try to make contact the Wells Fargo Fraud Investigation Department ( Fraud Department ) directly. I was finally able to reach the Wells Fargo Fraud Department, but when I did, I was shocked when they informed me they had not yet received any of the supporting documentation for this fraud claim investigation. I had submitted this documentation to Ms. XXXX at least ten ( 10 ) days earlier. The Fraud Department told me they would try to contact Ms. XXXX themselves to request she forward them all of the information. I spoke to the Fraud Department again shortly thereafter. They reported they had reached out to Ms. XXXX and requested she send them the documentation, but she had still not provided the same. 
I spoke to Mr. XXXX and Ms. XXXX XXXX again on XXXX XXXX, 2021. Now, in sharp contrast to their previous communications which promised me the account was frozen and I would be getting my money back, they now advised me, I have to go back to Wells Fargo for further help. I did not know what to think at this point, but I was understandably not happy with the back and forth both XXXX and Wells Fargo have engaged in with me at this point. I'm especially upset with MsXXXX XXXX apparent lack of initiative and failure to pass on important documentation that I had provided to her, which was intended to enable Wells Fargo to take whatever actions they could to stop my {$24000.00} from being lost. If the money is truly gone at this point, and Wells Fargo and/or its Fraud Department could have prevented this from happening if MsXXXX XXXX had promptly passed on the documentation I provided, to the investigator, It seems like both banks are treating me like a pendulum and not helping me. It seems like clear negligence of Wells Fargo employees and here is why I strongly believe that : 1. Wire transfer was done on XX/XX/XXXX. I requested a swift recall on XXXX but Wells Fargo failed to issue a recall until XX/XX/XXXX. 

2. The bank never asked for any documentation from me to send it to their fraud investigation team. 

3. I proactively sent an email to the branch manager Ms. XXXX XXXX few days later to forward my police report/FBI report/hackers emails and all the relevant information. 

4. 20 days later I heard from Wells Fargo Employee XXXX XXXX that Wells Fargo investigator never received the papers and he will email her to request these papers. 

5. Next day she reached out to me saying she never got them and I have to send it to her again which I did. 

6. 2 Days later when I reached the wire department, I was told they still do not have them. 

7. If the Wells Fargo investigator doesnt have my papers, they can not offer the papers to XXXX investigator. 

Obviously Wells Fargo dropped the ball in my case causing me to short {$24000.00} based on their negligence and poor work ethics.

9/18/2021,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"Unfortunately I have no choice but to reach out here as I have exhausted all other methods of communication with PayPal, Synchrony Bank and the collections agency. All of these entities state the issue is the other agencies fault and are unwilling or incapable of accepting responsibility, providing assistance and refuse to speak to each other regarding my account, so that we may resolve this issue. 

I placed a purchase with PayPal a few months ago for an event that was ultimately cancelled. I waited for the refund, but it never came. I reached out to PayPal and they said the payment was in a weird status, they informed me that they were physically unable to do anything with the transaction, but they had me fax evidence that the event was cancelled and walked me through requesting a cancellation for the transaction. I put in the request, faxed over the evidence and after a few days they canceled the payment ; I thought that was the end of it. Unfortunately I am now finding out that PayPal has placed an unauthorized charge on my PayPal account for {$2000.00} and sold the account to collections without ever contacting me or informing me there was any kind of an issue. 

After many hours and many phone calls to Synchrony bank, PayPal and a collections agency, I have been told multiple times that neither party is willing to communicate with each other regarding my account, they are each telling me to contact the other company and theyre unwilling to provide a reasonable resolution. The only manager that im aware that I spoke with was from Synchrony Bank. She offered to issue a check in the amount of {$2000.00}, however she stated by issuing the check they would debit my PayPal  credit account for that {$2000.00} then reverse the refund transaction from the account leaving me to owe Synchrony Bank {$2000.00} for a purchase that was refunded. I am left with no reasonable resolution, a credit default against me and can only come to the conclusion that PayPal, Synchrony Bank and this collection agency are coordinating efforts to intentionally defraud customer accounts, sell those accounts to generate a profit, while also retaining the authority to prevent customers from escalating these issues and actively suppress attempts to contact their leadership for assistance. I have even gone as far as emailing PayPal and Synchrony Banks investor relations, reached out to leadership and company social media accounts, emailed Synchrony ethics division, filed a XXXX  XXXX  XXXX  complaint, submitted a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission, filed a complaint with the FBI, submitted an official report with the Texas Attorney General and filled out an official police report with local law enforcement in order to get this issue resolved and I am still unable to communicate with any executive leadership or get a resolution from PayPal or Synchrony Bank.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,TX,79118,None,Consent provided,Web,9/18/2021,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4733550
9/16/2021,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"As a victim of Wire Fraud between my Wells Fargo account to a different Wells Fargo account, I feel Wells Fargo did not do enough to protect me from the criminals and is protecting the criminals and themselves over me. I also feel Wells Fargo has been showing no interest in the facts about my case or interest in how I am being treated as their customer. The loss of this money will take me years to recover from and I feel I was given a false sense of protection from being robbed while conducting business entirely within the confines of Wells Fargos system. 

Every step along the way from the investigation and 3 complaints filed on my behalf, no one from Wells Fargo has actually reached out to me to hear the details of the fraud, followed up with me on my complaints, or taken steps to address the issues. The overarching problem is that I am repeatedly given the impression that I dont matter. I lost $ XXXX in this wire fraud that they could have recovered or prevented had they acted as quickly or had the safeguards in place as I was asking them to. 

XX/XX/2021 I was in the final week leading up to a house closing when I reached out to my real estate attorney via email inquiring about closing costs and process. 2 days later ( XX/XX/2021 ) I received a reply on that same email thread coming from my attorneys office email account directing me with instructions on how to submit the closing costs via wire transfer. Unknowingly to me, their email had been compromised and the criminals were providing the wire transfer instructions. Thinking it was my attorneys office, I followed their instructions and ended up wiring $ XXXX ( as a daily limit ) from my Wells Fargo online account to another Wells Fargo account. When the criminals replied they had received the money and provided further instructions on sending the balance due to a different account, I was surprised to see different account information. I called my attorneys office and they had no idea what I was talking about and confirmed the emails were fraudulent and I was directed to immediately call the bank. 

XX/XX/2021 Within 4 hours of the transaction I called Wells Fargos online fraud support line and through various transfers and over a period of 1.5 hours I was given a case number for the recall of funds and told the investigation would take between 5 and 10 days. There was no transparency why I was on hold for so long, why it would take so long to investigate, yet the agent I spoke with that night was assuring me everything would be fine. 

XX/XX/2021 The next morning I engaged with the Department of Justice in my district ( agent XXXX XXXX ) and local XXXX MA police ( detective XXXX XXXX ). The agent at the DOJ had a contact at Wells Fargo and reached out on my behalf with the documentation I provided the DOJ agent to Wells Fargo financial crimes investigator ( XXXX XXXX ). That investigator spoke to me via phone to tell me the email documentation has been received and investigation is underway. I should expect someone to reach out with more information and likely will have to fill out an indemnification form so that I won't sue the bank if the reclaimed money is contested by the recipient. 

XX/XX/2021 On the XXXX day I received a courtesy call ( as stated in the voicemail ) that my case has been assigned to XXXX XXXX. Expecting a call from the inspector but not receiving one, I called Wells Fargo on the XXXX day ( XX/XX/2021 ) for a status update and was told the case has been closed the day before with a denial of reclaiming the stolen funds and a letter sent out with the details of the investigation. At no point did the investigator ever reach out to me for any documents or details of the wire fraud circumstances. I asked to speak with the investigator and received a call back from XXXX XXXX 3 days later ( XX/XX/2021 ). 

XX/XX/2021 XXXX XXXX explained to me he had opened and closed the case on the same day, had not been in contact with the financial crimes investigator, XXXX XXXX, nor had he received any documentation or reached out to me for any details. XXXX XXXX would not provide any details on what happened in the investigation, why they didnt reach out to me, why I was on hold for an 1.5 hours when my initial case was created the night I called in, nor had any interest in receiving any more information from me about this case. XXXX XXXX said he would send my request to the Escalation Team and opened a complaint case. But could not provide a case number or provide a timeframe when I should receive a call or expect a response. 

XX/XX/2021 Four days later I received an email from XXXX @ XXXX with a response attached as a PDF restating their position to close the case with no return of funds. The complaint agent listed on the attachment as XXXX XXXX never reached out to me regarding what I was actually complaining about. XXXX XXXX  letter only addressed that the bank will not return my stolen funds. My attempts to reach out to XXXX XXXX via the listed phone number in the email were unsuccessful. 

XX/XX/2021 The next day via postal mail I finally received the initial letter from XXXX XXXX ( 9 days from when the case was closed ) which contained a one line explanation of why the case was closed : as the money will not be returned from the receiving bank, we are not able to reimburse you. Since Wells Fargo is the receiving bank of the funds, they are taking the position of protecting the criminal activity over me. 

In my attempts to reach XXXX XXXX to challenge the findings of the investigation, I have since had to open 2 other complaints. The subsequent complaint closed by XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/2021 ) had the nearly identical language in the denial of returning the funds nor had XXXX S reached out to me about my complaint. 

At this point I have complaints about the process and the disregard for the factual nature of the investigation, but no one from Wells Fargo has shown any interest in what the content of my complaint is and just responding to whatever the agent decides to enter into the complaint fields. The most recent complaint ( XX/XX/2021 ) that I filed while trying to speak with XXXX XXXX about the case, I was able to get the agent filling out the complaint form to read to me back what the complaint XXXX XXXX closed addressing which also had factually incorrect statements about the circumstances of the case. I was told this third complaint case that I was opening would be responded to within 3 business days and that the agent was including a note not to close the case without speaking with me first.

I filled out a W4, NDA, Employment Agreement and a XXXX Welcome Letter ( received by XXXX ). I was then connected with HR lead XXXX XXXX via email ( XXXX ) who stated XXXX would be paying for my work equipment. They sent me three checks via email totaling {$17000.00}, instructed that I deposit them and send them to their vendors in order to pay for work equipment ( XXXX, time clock, desk, scanner, printer, copier, barcode scanner, etc. ). I was told to make five wire transfers out ( two XXXX transfers and three wire transfers- one to XXXX XXXX  and two to XXXX XXXX ). On XX/XX/2021, at XXXX USAA picked up the last wire transfer for {$8500.00}, returned the transfer, so I was still delinquent and apparently liable for {$9400.00}.

Then they told me, on XX/XX/2021, at XXXX, that if I wanted access to my account that I had to pay off the delinquent balance that I was scammed out of "" even though this is not my fault and hundreds of people this quarter alone have had this same thing happen to them ''. So, I did pay off the {$9400.00} in order to have access to my VA XXXX payments and remaining {$5000.00} to pay bills. I called after trying to access my left-over funds, I called USAA on XX/XX/2021, at XXXX, asking why my bills were rejected and for an update to my issue, which they previously said I would be kept up to date on, and they said they were going to close my accounts and keep my funds, both that paid off the scam and the remainder in my account and that I am not allowed access to any of these funds. I have been with USAA for 10 years, always paid early, always held a positive balance, and never had a complaint against me, and now I'm refused service, access to my own money, and treated like a criminal, while USAA says "" too bad you can't pay your bills that's not our problem ''. I asked them what I'm supposed to do that they won't allow me to pay my bills, and they said if I keep pressing, they will take me to court for "" gross negligence ''. I feel incredibly threatened by the company that is supposed to have my interest, I have worked openly with them, and they, themselves, have said this is not my fault, but their actions are aggressive, threatening and life-ruining. So now I'm using credit, cancelling utilities, and out the remainder of my savings AND I was informed that they would no longer be trying to retrieve those wire transfers to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX  because I had already paid off the delinquent balance. This is all being handled poorly and I feel that USAA is scamming scam-victims, especially after they confessed to this happening to hundreds of other customers this quarter alone.

9/10/2021,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Foreign currency exchange,Unexpected or other fees,None,"Back in XX/XX/2021 with Wells Fargo, I was told there was only a {$35.00} fee to wire transfer money to XXXX and those were the only fees I would incur. Well I came to find out, it cost me about {$700.00} more to wire transfer the amount of money as Wells Fargo had what I consider XXXXhidden fees '. A the time they said the exchange rate I was bring charged was the 'going rate '. After I made a complaint, they did respond stating they had a different rate to cover risks, cover costs they incur, etc. In all of the paperwork they gave me at the end, it might have been in the fine print but what they tell you verbally is completely different. I complained that these are hidden fees and they are basically lying. 

Today, I called a local branch and asked about exchanging US dollars to Euros for my trip with Wells Fargo and was told that a local branch could handle and there was no fee at all. Not even the {$35.00} fee. Just the current foreign exchange rate. Once again, this cost me an extra {$260.00} to exchange the money due to their exchange rate being so much higher. On their marketing document at the bank in very small print it states 'The exchange rate applied to a transaction includes a mark-up, which is an amount over and above the costs of funds to Wells Fargo and it is designed to compensate Wells Fargo for several considerations, including without limitation, risks taken, costs incurred, services rendered, as well as a return for the Wells Fargo on the transaction. ' Nothing I signed stated that I acknowledge this 'mark-up '. This is merely on the marketing brochure in the branch. Nothing on the receipt I received states this information. 

I just feel this is a deceptive practice being run by Wells Fargo and that their employees need to advise all customers making a foreign exchange transaction that there is a 'mark-up ' fee and be very clear on the disclosure, with customer signature, of what fees they are paying above and beyond.

9/1/2021,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Virtual currency,Other service problem,None,"I have been a PAYPAL Holdings INC member for 9 years and theyve processed over {$1.00} XXXX in payments for me. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email stating that I can no longer use PayPal. I immediately called PAYPAL on XX/XX/XXXX to find out why I was suspended and they would not give me any specific answers. Just stating restricted items. I spent about six hours on the phone trying to figure out why I was suspended with PayPal giving me no answers and refusing to reinstate my account. They told me the decision is final and I can not appeal. 

Since I was pretty sure I did not violate PAYPALs acceptable use policy and I know PAYPALs history of wrongfully suspending people I decided to file a complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX. I received specific answers through the XXXX  from PAYPAL stating that there were several risk factors associated with my account. Upon reading the risk factors PAYPAL claimed as to why I was suspended I did not recognize any of the information. I will provide the information below however based on the information I received through the XXXX XXXX XXXX I assumed that someone had potentially created a PayPal account in my name. I called PAYPAL upon receiving the information from the XXXX XXXX XXXX  report and XXXX with PAYPAL created a ticket ID XXXX to have my account reinstated. PAYPAL made claims that I received {$2600.00} in friends and family payments and I knew that was incorrect when I called them they confirmed to me that I receive XXXX dollars USD on my PayPal account. PAYPAL also claimed that I had one or more accounts that were associated with my information and that it had limited access. I explained to PAYPAL that I only have one account this one that I created XXXX years ago. After waiting 10 days I received an email simply stating that my account would remain suspended forever. 

After spending literally hours on the phone with PAYPAL they would not tell me where they were getting this information from they would not tell me why I was still being suspended if they could not prove this information was correct. I explained to PAYPAL that I did not recognize the information I did not do any of it therefore I did not violate PAYPALs acceptable use policy and explained that my account should not be suspended if I did not violate any policies. PAYPAL even went as far as to tell me that if someone stole my information and created another account and did something that I had no knowledge of it would not matter they would still keep my account suspended and that the decision was final. 

The truth is that PAYPAL has been wrongfully suspending people for years maybe the entire time theyve been in business. Based on what it looks like on my end it appears that PAYPAL made up information to suspend my account because they can not verify that any of the information that they provided is accurate or true or that it even happened. 

Here is my response to the XXXX  case I have not heard back from PAYPAL at this time. 

The consumer indicated he/she DID NOT accept the response from the business. ) Hi XXXX  I'm sorry I can not accept this as a resolution for the reasons outlined below. I have been in contact with PayPal via phone and explain the situation. XXXX was very helpful and opened a ticket for me which at this time is still in review. The ticked id # is XXXX. Based on the limited information provided it appears someone created an account with my info sent money around and possibly sold a restricted item. 

I see that you have reached out to our customer support team via call from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/2021 where you asked for detailed explanation on account limitation and funds being held however, teammates provided only basic information on limitation due to proprietary reason. Below is the detailed explanation. 

The first thing I noticed is I did not receive an email from PayPal about my account suspension until the XXXX of XXXX. Above it states I was in contact starting XX/XX/XXXX which I wasn't. I immediately called PayPal on the XXXX which records will show from my registered phone number. 

A recent review of your PayPal account shows that onXXXX XXXX, XXXX, PayPal placed limitationXXXXXXXX on your account as we found there may be excessive risk involved in doing business with you, following risk factors were identified : - Multiple accounts with limited access - Based on a review of your account, we show that you are associated to one or more PayPal accounts which currently have limited access and we can confirm that the accounts share the following information : financials, phone number, email address and address. 

I do not have any other PayPal accounts nor have I created ANY PayPal accounts since this one XXXX  years ago. Prior to that I had a personal PayPal account which I stopped using once I opened this business account. I don't see how it's possible to share the same email for separate PayPal accounts and the financial info is also very concerning. I have not seen any transactions come through my bank out of the ordinary and I confirmed with my bank there have been no breaches. 

Your account has received an excessive amount of personal payments sent as Friends/Family. In the past you received XXXX payments from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX totaling {$2600.00} USD. These payments pose a higher risk of reversal due to chargebacks or ACH returns and are not eligible for Seller Protection. 



I use my PayPal account to take payments for my business and although I sometimes send money to friends and family I knew this amount was incorrect. I confirmed with the agent XXXX that I had only made a single {$40.00} payment as friends and family not received {$2600.00} as stated above so this information was very alarming. I received {$0.00} USD in friends and family payments which PayPal confirmed. 

I explained everything to XXXX on my call on XX/XX/XXXX. I told him I do not have any other accounts nor have I created any accounts since opening this one XXXX  years ago. I told him that I definitely did not send {$2600.00} in friends and family payments and he confirmed I paid only one {$40.00} payment and took in website payments. XXXX took my complaint seriously and created a ticket. He said if you didn't do anything wrong we had no reason to suspend you to which I agreed. 

The fact is that I have absolutely no knowledge of the provided information and I know for a fact I did not create any other accounts or send that amount in friends and family which makes PayPal account reflects. After thinking about it I asked myself why would I need to create an additional PayPal account to transfer money around when I already have a PayPal account and can use many other means to send funds if needed. It would literally make no sense for me to even take the time to create an additional PayPal account. 

So even though you said I can not appeal etc in light of this new and disturbing information I request that you look into this situation immediately so we can get to the bottom of this. Not only do I need to get my account reinstated since I have done nothing wrong but also I need to know that my bank account info etc is safe and not compromised. 

I had told PayPal agents are over and over again that I did not violate the acceptance use policy since I knew I didn't. Then when I received this info I knew I was correct and contacted PayPal immediately. They are currently looking into this situation and I am expecting that my account will be reinstated since I did not do anything mentioned in this report or violate the acceptable use policy. 

If there was a restricted item sold it was not on my account it was on the account someone created in my name. So what we have here is a case of identity theft. I think you would agree with me that it would not be fair to suspend me because someone stole my identity and created a PayPal account. If that is what happened. 

I am here to work with PayPal and I am willing to provide any necessary documentation or information to get my account reinstated. I am also willing to cooperate with any potential investigation. I know for a fact I did not create any PayPal accounts, receive {$2600.00} in friends and family, or sell any restricted items. Therefore I did not violate the acceptable use policy. 

I take payments for gold and silver, send and pay invoices etc with my PayPal account. I very rarely send money as friends and family. Therefore if I have done nothing wrong I should not be suspended. This has already disrupted my business and taken a mental toll on me. I have spent hours and hours on the phone with PayPal because I know for a fact I am completely innocent of ANY wrongdoing. 

Therefore I can not accept being suspended from PayPal for the rest of my life. I shouldn't be suspended now and I don't understand why ips, devices, etc etc were not checked before suspending me. I can guarantee there were no accounts created on my ip or any of my devices. I did not create any PayPal accounts on any other devices nor did I instruct anyone to create a PayPal account or accounts with my info. 

I am hoping that by the time you receive this my account has been re-evaluated and reinstated. I will also remind you that a full security check was done on my account in XXXX. I had to send in documents and everything checked out fine as it should have been. 

I am responding to this case to shed some light on the situation and because I only have 10 days. I have had a great relationship with PayPal and once this situation is fixed I hope to continue having a good business relationship moving forward. Again I have done nothing wrong therefore I should not be suspended. 

I have emailed you at the email provided but at this time have not received a response. Please look into this situation if necessary as I said PayPal is reviewing all of this information currently in order to move forward with reinstating my PayPal account. 

I look forward to your response and working with PayPal again. If you need any additional information please let me know. 
Kind Regards XXXX I believe PAYPAL made all of this information up just to give them a reason to suspend me because I have no knowledge of any of it. They would not tell me where they were getting the {$2600.00} from that I supposedly received and they confirmed that I did not have any other accounts in my name. I know I didnt sell any restricted items because all I do is sell precious metals and I did not sell anything out of the ordinary. There have been a lot of people recently showing up in online forums etc. that have been also wrongfully and from PAYPAL. If people violate PayPals acceptable use policy then I guess it is OK for PAYPAL to suspend them. However if PAYPAL is literally making up things to suspend people like they did with me I think you would agree that this kind of business practice has no place in the financial sector. This has hurt my sales on my website taking hours and hours of my time caused a tremendous amount of stress on me and the truth is I did not violate PAYPALs acceptable use policy. 

PAYPAL has a history of wrongfully suspending and banning people for the rest of their lives and I believe this business practice needs to be stopped. PAYPAL is hurting innocent business owners, the economy and humanity in general by wrongfully suspending peoples PayPal accounts. I even told PAYPAL that if they had given me a valid reason as to why I was why I was suspended then I would not have even questioned them for suspending me. I have known about PAYPALs history ever since I created a PayPal account XXXX years ago but I never really looked into it too much. 

It is my opinion that these business practices all of them need to stop immediately you can not ban people when they have done nothing wrong you can not hurt peoples businesses when they have done nothing wrong. 

I hope you can help me to make sure that PAYPAL does not continue to get away with these shady business practices and wrongfully suspending people and banning them from PAYPAL. Not only did they block my PayPal account they also blocked my Venmo account and they will also not let me check out through an actual PayPal system on websites. So my debit card is even blocked from being able to be used on the PAYPAL system. This whole situation is completely ridiculous on PAYPALs part and should be illegal. 

I hope that I have provided enough information for you to be able to take action if you have any questions please feel free to contact me.",None,"Paypal Holdings, Inc",NC,284XX,None,Consent provided,Web,9/1/2021,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4682657

After literal months of every day calling nonstop like a full time job I did not recieve any of my money, but I learned, what I believe, to be the worst thing you can do to someone. Give them, "" the Run Around ''! I filled out popped r reports, disputes with banks and even contacted the XXXX, FTC, ombudsman, and even the attorney General. Nothing. A flicker of hope tho when I found your number. Now I had an ATM, owned by U.S bank, eat my deposit. Now I am a member with U.S bank, but this was about 2 weeks before I signed up.

I actually did them a favor by letting them know that they need to update their terms of service because after calling nonstop by the 3rd week they updated the rules and added my exact issue in their rule book, so that solves my problem on their end. I broke the rules, so they can't help me. That should be illegal. Anyway, this ATM is on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX inside an XXXX XXXX. Now, to my detriment, 2 days after this incident the U.S bank branch at this location closed, so all that's left is the ATM. XXXX XXXX would not help me, in fact all these businesses treated me like I was trying to steal from them and made me feel like a drug addict. I actually got very XXXX because this was ALL my money and at the same time I was jumped and robbed for another XXXX a few days before. Sorry I'm just trying to set the scene and this is my last attempt, so I might as well give it my all, right? Moving on, even having a receipt didn't help me. A physical receipt I showed all of them, but nobody helped me. Now, due to time, it has worn away and it's practically useless.

9/14/2021,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Virtual currency,Fraud or scam,None,"XX/XX/2021 I was called by a "" fraudster banker '' from a Wells Fargo number ( Wells Fargo caller ID, verified number ) saying someone was trying to add themselves as a recipient to my account to wire transfer {$2300.00}, which would drain my account. I was asked for information like account number, PIN, birthdate, last 4 digits of SSN, etc., and I navely gave them the information, as I trusted that I speaking to a real banker. They were sending me verification codes to my phone number from official Wells Fargo SMS messages. They tell me they would have to initiate the transfer in order to open an investigation on the claim. 

XX/XX/2021 I call Wells Fargo to check on the status of the "" claim. '' Told by the representative that they have no claim number under the one I was given. We realize then that I was a victim of fraud. Rep now opens a claim, closes my bank account, and opens a new one. Tells me he would contact me with a resolution within 5 business days. 

XX/XX/2021 I call to check on claim status. I am told it was denied and closed the day before, XX/XX/XXXX. I was never called or notified. I ask rep if there is any way to reverse the decision, and she tells me it is possible. Says she would put in a request for the investigator, the original representative from XXXX, to call me back and run through the situation again, and that he should call within 2 business days. I ask if there is anything I could do to help my case. She tells me that in the claim 's notes, it was written that I did not file a police report, and that I should. I WAS NEVER ASKED IF I FILED A POLICE REPORT during that phone call, nor ever advised that I should from the original rep. I realized then that my claim may have already been mishandled by that original representative. 

XX/XX/2021 I call Wells Fargo again, since I never received a call. I am in the process of filing a police report at this point and ask for information about the transfer, such as the recipient 's real name, their bank name, locations, etc., as this is some of what the report asks for. This rep tells me they have no information regarding the transfer. I ask how they have no information, and she tells me their notes only provide details from calls. I realize then that the original rep came up with his resolution with no actual information regarding the transfer. This rep tells me she can put in a request for the investigator to call me back in 2 business days, yet again. I tell her I had already put in a request and was not called back, which was the reason I called that day. She tells me the "" notes '' say I was called on XXXX, and I supposedly hung up. I received zero calls before or after I called on XXXX. No calls show up in my phone history, and no voicemail, email, any type of notification was left whatsoever. The rep from XXXX also never mentioned me having been called, so I feel this statement was falsified. Regardless, I still never received a call between my XXXX and XXXX calls. This representative proceeds to put in another request for a call-back. I ask her if I should be receiving the call from the same fraud department number, or if it would be from a different Wells Fargo number. She responds that it would be from the fraud department. 

XX/XX/2021 I get a call from a representative, who was not the original investigator, from a random number from North Carolina. At this point already, I see that Wells Fargo representatives do not even have cohesive answers to my questions, since I was told the day before that I would be called from the fraud department, and I was not. This phone call was just to give me some information about the transfer, like I had asked the day before. I realize then that I was only called because they now had a note that said I was filing a police report, not because I wanted to run through the situation of my claim again. I ask this rep if again, there are any chances I could still get my money back. She tells me Wells Fargo gets XXXX attempts to reverse the transfer, and they have only tried once so far. The original representative denied and closed my case after ONE ATTEMPT. If I had not told these reps that I was filing a police report, this information would not have been relayed to me, and I truly believe the last two attempts would not be made. The representative tells me to just "" keep a look out '' to see if the money would appear back in my account; did not say I would be notified of any changes or anything. These Wells Fargo representatives do the least for their customers and leave them in the dust when they need help most. 
I received a letter later that day, denying my claim as I was told stating, "" As the money will not be returned from the receiving bank, we are not able to reimburse you. '' This "" investigator '' denied and closed my claim with the reasoning of "" the money will not be returned from the receiving bank '' after having only tried ONCE out of their three attempts to reverse the transfer. This letter was dated XX/XX/XXXX, but was not sent until XXXX, and I did not receive it until the XXXX ( picture attached. ) There is absolutely no sense of urgency by these bankers about something so time-sensitive and as crucial as this situation. I followed the policy instructions of notifying the bank of situations like this, and they still did the very bare-minimum. There is a complete lack of communication from them with their customers, unless they are made aware that an official report, like my police report, is being filed. 
I have turned in my police report at this point ( XX/XX/XXXX ), and have made a security freeze to my credit file as well, which I also had to find out about on my own, when I wish I had been informed about by the very company I trusted to handle my money. I have no income and have had almost no money for nearly three weeks because I have been getting the run-around by these bankers, and they have completely failed me by not fully attempting to help me get my money back. And there still leaves the question of how this "" fraudster banker '' was able to identify that I was a Wells Fargo customer and retrieved my name and contact information, called from a Wells Fargo number, and sent SMS messages from Wells Fargo, if not for a security breech in the Wells Fargo system.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,TX,751XX,None,Consent provided,Web,9/14/2021,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,4720723

Mr. XXXX reported that : {$7000.00} had just been transferred from my Wells Fargo saving account ( # XXXX ), to my checking account ( # XXXX ) A Wells Fargo Online Wires Enrollment had just been established for the account ; A Wire Transfer Recipient named XXXX XXXX had just been enrolled for my account ; and A Wire Transfer in the amount of {$23000.00} had just been sent from my checking account to XXXX XXXX Mr. XXXX then asked if I had taken or approved the above actions. I told them that I had not, and requested that the wire transfer be stopped and/or reversed immediately. 
Mr. XXXX asked for my online account password and Social Security number. I provided the former but not the later. He texted me several security codes to my cell phone and asked me to confirm them, which I did. 
Several hours after the above conversation, I received emails from Wells Fargo documenting each of the unauthorized actions Mr. XXXX reported : Tuesday, XX/XX/2021, XXXX XXXX  EDT : Your Transfer is Being Processed - {$7000.00} from savings account ( XXXX ) to checking account ( XXXX ) Tuesday, XX/XX/2021, XXXX XXXX  EDT : You signed up for Wells Fargo Online Wires Tuesday, XX/XX/2021, XXXX XXXX EDT : Your Wire Transfer Recipient has been added ( XXXX XXXX ) Tuesday, XX/XX/2021, XXXX XXXX  EDT : Your Wire Transfer is Being Processed - {$23000.00} moved to account XXXX from my checking account XXXX. 
Copies of the above emails are attached. I subsequently filed a theft report with the PA State Police case number XXXX. 
On XX/XX/2021 Wells Fargo closed both my checking and savings accounts and my credit/debit card account and opened new accounts. However, Wells Fargo did not re-credit my account for the unauthorized transfers. 
On XX/XX/2021, I called Wells Fargos Online Claim Office ( XXXX ) and was told that a fraudulent transfer claim had been initiated on XX/XX/2021, but they were unable to provide any information. On XX/XX/2021 Wells Fargo sent an unsigned letter to me denying my claim ( # XXXX ), asserting that after investigation weve determined that the transaction was performed by you or someone who had your authorization. A copy of that letter is enclosed. On XX/XX/2021 I called the Wells Fargos Online Claim Office ( XXXX ) and spoke with an agent named XXXX. I asked why my claim was denied. He provided the following information : XXXX said according to the notes in my claim record the claim was denied because the beneficiary bank had not responded to Wells Fargos request to return funds. Note that my letter from Wells Fargo ( attached ) states the beneficiary bank did respond to Wells Fargo saying there were no funds available to return. 
XXXX said he would re-request that Wells Fargo contact the beneficiary bank. I requested that I be informed of any outcome. 
XXXX indicated there was no record of Wells Fargo attempting to obtain the computer IP address from where the bank transactions were made. 

I believe Wells Fargo was negligent in their investigation and they should re-credit my account in the amount of {$23000.00}.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,PA,18062,None,Consent provided,Web,10/1/2021,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,4771678

The reason for our filing relates to the following rationale : As stated in your letter dated XX/XX/2021, we requested support from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for a return of our money since you allowed an outside source to wire transfer approximately {$14000.00} of our funds which was unauthorized by us. Our dilemma is that we feel Citibank was totally responsible and assume that you have sufficient insurance to cover our loss. 
Secondly, since we still have some of our money in our accounts your office suggested that we call the XXXX number and request that you reopen our account o or obtain assistance from your support office to open up a new account so that we would have access to our remaining funds. After spending 1 hour on the phone with your staff we were advised that they were not able to assist us in our efforts to open an account and they did not offer any options on helping us. Furthermore, the individuals were unable to communicate clearly due to the fact that they were not Americans and appeared to be struggling with their XXXX accent to communicate with us other than advise us that no help was available. We will file a follow-up complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Florida State Attorney General because there seems to be an ongoing struggle to get any help. Since your bank has caused this problem, you should have the courtesy in correcting it. We are asking for two things refund our money and have the courtesy to allow us to have access to our account.

After contacting my son to see if it was him, he said that he didn't but he had received an email from someone who was claiming to be his XXXX. and that she was paying him for helping her move and sent him a check via email and when he clicked the email link is when I received the text notification and a deposit of {$5000.00} was made pending into his account. We immediately contacted USAA to inform them of what had taken place and was asked by the agent if either of us had tried to send a XXXX transaction to someone named XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$1000.00}, to which neither of us knew nor did we attempt to send that XXXX transaction, in fact neither of us even knew what a XXXX was. The agent then advised that she would put in a request to stop the transactions, both the {$5000.00} pending deposit and the {$1000.00} withdawal, due to it being a fraudulent attempt and with it being Sunday and the bank being closed on that Monday due to a holiday that it would be Tuesday before the Fraud dept would contact us or be able to do anything.So we waited until Tuesday but didnt hear or receive a response. So we called back on XX/XX/XXXX, when we saw that the transactions were still pending, and was routed to the fraud department and explained everything again. The agent told us that he didn't see where my son 's phone was hacked nor the account and that if either of us ever tried making a deposit in that amount again through email then they would no longer do business with us, inspite us explaining to him that the transaction had to have been a result of a phinishing scam when he accessed the email. The agent still made it seem as if this was done by XXXX and was making us out to be at fault. He then said that he would try and get to the bottom of it and asked if we could provide the email addresses that the transactions came from and we did that, he then told us that the account would remain in hold status until the money ( {$1000.00} ) was put back into the account and they would look into the incident. on XX/XX/XXXX my son received an email stating that the case was closed due to no fraud detected and then they went into my husband and my personal account and transferred the money to our sons account to bring it current without any notification whatsoever. Called back on XX/XX/XXXX to follow up and was told that the case was closed but they would reopen it because once again I had to explain the whole situation all over again and was told by this agent that a request to reopen the case was submitted. Called back on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to the fraud dept. and was told that the case was closed on XXXX ... .at this point I am more than furious at the lack of assistance and this situation being resolved. I was then transferred to the XXXX XXXX dept. and had to once again explain the situation over again and the agent was not understanding why more wasn't done to have the looked into and said that she would open the case for further evaluation and was given a case # XXXX to refer to and then a few days later I received a letter stating that the case has been reopened and that they would be investigating to see what can be done and that since all of this started XXXX XXXX users were issued a security alert that their phones could be accessed and the hackers could get in and attack their accounts, but still nothing as far as help from USAA. Called back today XXXX and was told that on XX/XX/XXXX the case went from the dispute department back to the fraud department and on XX/XX/XXXX once again, stated that no fraud was found and was sent back to the dispute department on XX/XX/XXXX and closed. I tried asking the agent if USAA operates under the Federal Reserves and is this not covered under the Regulations that protect consumers from fraud, she put me on hold and cut off the line.

As the check was written on Wells Fargo, I went there to cash it on XX/XX/XXXX. They refused.

Nevertheless, on Monday XX/XX/XXXX, my partner and I arranged for lunch times to go over to Wells Fargo. They again refused to cash the check that was drawn on them!!! 

They went on to tell us that even if they were willing to cash it, there would be a XXXX dollar check cashing fee. When did banks XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX hold our money hostage? 

There is nothing about the situation that I am OK with. If I couldnt cash the check, which the teller had on Saturday, she should not have told me I had to come in on Monday with my partner.

The day of his funeral, Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX, I was trying to arrange with movers to take my brother 's belongings from a XXXX XXXX facility to our home in Florida. The movers wanted a deposit to be paid through XXXX rather than check or credit card which I felt was fine. 

My husband and I have joint accounts with SunTrust, now Truist, and I handle all the banking ; my husband doesn't do any of it. 

We have used XXXX before and I was trying to pay the movers through XXXX and had a problem with the transaction. When I called SunTrust, the representative asked if my husband was available because I needed my husband 's "" permission '' to make this important transaction as his name was first on the account. 

I told the rep that my husband was not there, which he wasn't, and I didn't need his permission as this is a joint account and I won't open up another account in order to justify this transaction. The rep and I went back and forth with this and nothing was accomplished and I was extremely upset and angry. Yes, I do have a temper and I did curse. I went through XXXX trying to pay these movers, not only for the deposit but for the final balance as well. 

I tried going through the chat with SunTrust and that didn't help either. They could have cared less that I was burying my brother the day I called because they wanted my husband to call them to give his "" permission to the little woman. '' They have now suspended our online banking as a result of this situation because I refuse to let my husband call them.

It's the principal of the matter ; plus they caused me such grief the day of the funeral and thereafter due to this scenario. I will never forgive SunTrust for how they handled this delicate situation in such a thoughtless manner! 

I now have to go through my brother 's Guardian /Conservator ( I am the G/C ) account in order to pay our mortgage or check our other accounts. SunTrust just keeps piling on the grief! 

This isn't the first time I've had problems with SunTrust. They wouldn't let me close my deceased brother 's business account, even with proper documentation, until I mentioned that I was going to contact my lawyer.
